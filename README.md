# Play Tetris!
 Play a game of Tetris! Built using ReactJS.

 #### Why Tetris?
  Why not?! Tetris is a fun game and this project gives me a chance to re-sharpen my ReactJS skills. This game would probably be better with vanilla JS + faster too, but this is just to see how ReactJS would work with it. 

 ## Getting Started
 
Open up the command line or terminal and run the following:
``` 
cd tetris-react
npm start 
``` 

 ## Running the Test suites
 Coming soon!
